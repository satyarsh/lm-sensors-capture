# lm-sensors output capture!
a bash Script that Captures the output of the lm-sensors command and saves it in a text file.

First give the script a text file path then how frequent do you want it to output to a file (value is in seconds)

basically create a text file of your choice and give the path of it to the script.

Make sure that the text file you are writing to has write privileges(sudo chmod 777 path_of_file) and lm-sensors is installed! 

Ctrl + C to quit out of the Script.
